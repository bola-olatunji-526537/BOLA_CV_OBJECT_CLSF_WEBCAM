# BOLA_CV_OBJECT_CLSF_WEBCAM
Object classification/face recognition model, predicting with live webcam video and image feed


PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project involves writing code to generate datasets from raw snapped photos, training multiple face recognition models, and integrating these models to make real-time predictions from a live PC webcam feed.

In Phase 2 (private repository), all components are combined into a fully functional website for continuous security authentication. The system ensures that only authorized users can access the website, instantly denying access to any unauthorized faces.
